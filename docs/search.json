I used dplyr and ggplot2 to calculate new cases, deaths, and per capita metrics. I also created visualizations to explore patterns across Colorado counties and between states like New York, Colorado, Ohio, and Alabama. I practiced data normalization, rolling averages, faceted plots, and spatial analysis by calculating weighted centers of case locations."

I used chi-square tests to examine relationships between categorical variables, t-tests to compare group means, and correlation tests to assess associations between continuous variables. I also practiced using ANOVA and regression models to analyze crab size variation across different sites and environmental gradients. This lab helped strengthen my understanding of statistical assumptions and proper interpretation of p-values, confidence intervals, and model diagnostics."

Each proposal included a clear title, justification supported by peer-reviewed sources, a defined research question or hypothesis, proposed methods using at least two datasets, and expected outcomes. This assignment helped me think critically about study design, data integration, and how to formulate testable questions within ecological and environmental science. We compiled all group members’ proposals into a single Quarto manuscript and published it online through GitHub Pages."

I also created maps to visualize key predictors and learned how to build a full modeling pipeline using tidymodels in R. This lab helped me understand how to compare models and test how well they perform on new data."

I practiced creating a machine learning workflow in R with tidymodels, applied feature engineering steps (like logging and normalization), and ran a hyperparameter search using a Latin Hypercube grid. I evaluated model performance using cross-validation and selected the best combination of parameters (trees, tree depth, and learning rate). My final model achieved strong performance, with an R² of 0.912 and RMSE of 0.354 on the test set, showing it generalized well. I also visualized spatial predictions and residuals, which highlighted regional trends in streamflow across the U.S."

I mapped the 100 mile border zone and found that over 9,800 cities, home to more than half the US population, fall within this area. I also visualized the largest cities in the zone and explored how geography can influence legal and policy boundaries. This lab helped me apply spatial analysis tools to real world issues."

We used emissions and energy data from 2015 to 2022 to analyze trends, run ANOVA tests, and build machine learning models. Our key findings showed that GDP per capita, land use, and fossil fuel use were major predictors of emission patterns. This talk helped us practice science communication and present complex results in a clear, engaging format.\n\nReturn to Home"
